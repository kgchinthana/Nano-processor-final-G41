# Nano-processor-final-G41
## Introduction

This project involves the design and implementation of a 4-bit nanoprocessor capable of executing a set of instructions. It is part of a team project where students work collaboratively to build various components, develop an assembly program, and demonstrate the functionality of the nanoprocessor.

## Project Overview

The nanoprocessor project consists of the following key components:
- 4-bit Add/Subtract unit for signed integers
- 3-bit adder for incrementing the Program Counter
- 3-bit Program Counter with reset capability
- Various k-way b-bit multiplexers
- Register Bank with 8, 4-bit registers
- Program ROM for storing the assembly program
- Buses for connecting components
- Instruction Decoder to activate components based on instructions

The project also includes an assembly program designed to calculate the total of integers between 1 and 3 and store the result in Register R7.
